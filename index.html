      <p> I am a recent Full Stack Web Developer and graduate from the Thinkful Bootcamp. I admire coding because I am able to identify a problem figure it out by coding. I welcome the  challenge of problem solving and that feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction when I reason out a good challenge. I mostly enjoy the art of coding because in a way it relates to my favorite hobbies which are painting, drawing, and clothing design, all of which make me feel like Iâ€™ve created something from nothing. I am especially excited to work among skilled developers who i can learn from and grow in my journey as a web developer. 
      </p>
      <p>When I'm not coding you can find me working on my clothing business, painting, reading, working out, or admiring nature.

      <p> This project was built for anyone wanting to learn the capitals of 5 countries. What inspired me to build this project was my passion for traveling and learning about different cultures. This app displays 5 questions with 4 multiple choice options, the question number the user is currently on,
      and a score which updates when the user clicks the submit button. It return the right answer if the user answers incorrectly and it
      congratulates the user if they answer correctly. Lastly it shows their final score and offers them a chance to retake the quiz.</p>
